Apache redirects to /org_icons -- on a separate drive -- to access the customized org icons.

MySQL stores a BOOLEAN -- i.e. TINTYINT(1) -- as TRUE for custom, and FALSE for default
Custom  --> /org_icons/SID
Default --> /frontEnd/org_icons_default/Archetype

For modularity, icons are still scraped independently from their URLs.
For efficiency, the full URL is stored in a separate table that the back/front ends never access.
The icon scraper reads the isolated table -- which contains SID and Icon -- and downloads the corresponding images.
