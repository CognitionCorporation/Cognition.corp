Cognition Corp website and database development (pre-alpha)

Use npm to install the required library files (run it once). Then switch to PHP5 for local hosting, as npm does not run php scripts. You may also need Bower for installation.

To host the app locally, add and run dependencies. Debian-based GNU distributions have six required steps:

1) $ sudo apt-get install npm

2) $ npm intstall angular-resource

3) $ npm start

4) close npm

5) $ php -S localhost:8000

6) using a web browser, navigate to localhost:8000/frontEnd.html

Once you've configured the website once, you can skip steps 1-5. Host the MySQL database using MySQL-server, Apache2, and PhpMyAdmin.
