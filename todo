DB:
	ommit duplicate data in history (i.e. use delta updating) and change chart interpolation on details-view to match

Images:
	***use RSI URL on grid view for higher quality images
	automatically update images when changed

Front End:
	delete or update libreJS compatibility

Misc:
	the SC-API does not scrape exclusive status (need workaround)
