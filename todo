Database:
	change collation to UTF8-CI (case insensitive),
	and encode/decode text on only the front end
	
	Future conflict-views:
	not allow more than 9 affiliates
	not allow an affiliate without a main
	not allow multiple OrganizationMemberHistory logs for the same day

	optionally add PersonFluencies??

PopulateOrgs.php:
	occasionally a query fails:
		for all orgs, this is a critical failure, as the script thinks it's done and terminates;
		we could make it try 2-3 times and then terminate successfully (and print a warning if
		it didn't loop many times; that would indicate a connection problem and we should rerun the script later)
		for individual orgs, we should just have it try again 2-3 times and print a warning if it fails
		
	complete step 7 (recluster tuples on index)
	
	read and interpret timestamp info from API
	
	break language into a separate script so we can use live queries
	
Controllers:
	improve readability of checkbox-related code
	
ER diagram:
	change FullOrganizations to FullOrgs
	fix clustering on diagram for all tables that don't show it as a primary key

Misc:
	the SC-API does not seem to scrape exclusive status (need workaround)
