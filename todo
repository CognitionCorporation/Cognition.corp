DB Population:
	* delete orgs that no longer exist (maybe keep them on a deleted list instead?)
	* calculate growth rate on the fly

Misc:
	the SC-API does not scrape exclusive status (need workaround)
	
Front End:
	add WebGL effects
	add banner/footer

Constraints:
	CHECK( Size == Main + Affiliate + Hidden )//RSI does not have data integrity, so size is often +- 1
